This is a very basic module that is still in development. 

The goal for this project is to create a pause button for the players that will anonymously pause the game, mute all mics, and turn off all webcams. The core reasoning for this module is to protect the players' identities if they are feeling triggered or need something to be addressed right in that moment before the game goes any further.

This module is still in 'loose' development. It will likely be updated in the future, but as we are in the early testing phases, the goal is to ensure it is working properly before we finalize making it look nice.
